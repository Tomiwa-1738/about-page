<h3>Return & Refund Policy</h3><br>

<h3>Last updated on April 25, 2025.</h3><br><br><br>
<p>Thanks for shopping with <strong>Binkybox!</strong><br>

We want you to be happy with your purchases, so we offer refunds for complaints made within six (6) hours of delivery.<br>
To learn more about our refund policy, please read this guide. But please keep in mind that once you've paid for items, you can't cancel your order on the day of delivery. If you do need a refund, we'll process it through bank account, unless our refund policy says otherwise.

</p>
<br>

<h3>Guidelines for Refund.</h3><br>
<p>If we are unable to provide a food item you ordered at the requested time and your order is less than ₦5,000 (Five thousand naira), we will refund the amount to your wallet. You can use this refund to buy other items immediately or at a later time. If your order is above ₦5,000 (Five thousand naira), we can refund the amount directly to your bank account, whichever you prefer. Note that bank refunds are made within 48 hours after we have confirmed your bank account number. <br>
N.B: Please note that all returns/refunds will be considered on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the availability of the item, logistics, and reasonable grounds.
</p><br>

<h3>Eligibility for Refund.</h3><br>
<p>Perishable Food Items: Our refund policy for perishable food items covers a variety of products, including fresh tomatoes, fresh peppers, meat, fish, and fruits and vegetables. If you are unsatisfied with the quality of these items, you may request a refund within six (6) hours of receiving your delivery.<br>

Baby Items: Our refund policy for all baby items covers a variety of products, including pampers, cream, food, milk and snacks. If you are unsatisfied with the quality of these items, you may request a refund within (6) hours of receiving your delivery.	

To be eligible for a refund, you must have made a complaint to Binkybox on the day of delivery and provided picture or video evidence of the unsatisfactory order.

We typically require visual evidence to ensure that we can process your refund or return promptly. Non-Perishable Food Items: Our refund policy applies to various food items such as Grains (Rice, Beans, Corn), Roots (Plantain, Potatoes), Tubers (Yams), and other dry items (spices). If you receive any of these items and wish to return them, you must do so within 72 hours of delivery.<br>

However, there is a prerequisite for this return and refund to take place. You need to have lodged a valid complaint within six (6) hours of receiving the food items.

Our team at Binkybox will confirm your complaint, and we may request picture evidence to ensure a smooth return or refund process.
